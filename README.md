### ABOUT
Synonyms & Sugar is a single page [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) application that hits the [Merriam-Webster Collegiate Thesaurus API](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-thesaurus) to display synonyms for users. With a simple and clean UX/UI, users are able to search for any word's synonyms. The synoyms are then clickable, so the user can continue searching until they have found the perfect word.
